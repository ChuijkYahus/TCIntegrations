A Minecraft 1.18+ mod designed to provide modpack integrations with other mods for
[Tinkers' Construct](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct), as well as some other tweaks.

The main goal here is to not just add a bunch of random new materials from mods and call it "integration". The goal is to add materials where it makes sense, and capture the capabilities of other mods tools and armors in Tinkers' Construct. This started with Botania and wanting to have the ability to use mana generating inventory items to automatically repair tools. This entire concept has worked out well, and the idea moving forward is balanced integration.

Almost everything in the mod is datapack driven and can be overridden via datapack. Some of the mod integration abilities are hard coded to match the mod capability for the integration, which is intentional.

**Will take requests for other tweaks and integrations!**
